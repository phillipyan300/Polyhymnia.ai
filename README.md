# Hack Princeton 2023

This project is Yash, Phillip, and Matthew's submission for HackPrinceton 2023!

## Project introduction

Our project is a tool designed to help musicians of all skill levels assess their performances and improve their musical abilities, 
even without the help of a formal music tutor. We hope this helps make music education more accessible to all! 

## Project information
The application allows users to upload audio files and receive a comprehensive grade based on pitch, rhythm, and intonation, 
giving them a composite overview of their musical performance.

Users will also have the opportunity to select which aspect they wish to emphasize, so they can focus on their specific musical goals.

Our project includes innovative music generation methods (based on the Markov model) to procedurally generate melodies that 
closely replicate real composed music, but which also have an element of uniqueness and randomness.

Our project also makes use of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, taking inspiration from bioinformatics to innovatively judge music pitch.
